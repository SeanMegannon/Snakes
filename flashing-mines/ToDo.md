**Phase 5 Progress: 14/14 tasks complete**

## Phase 6: Full Cross-Version Regression Check (Estimated: 20 min)

☑ **6.1** Run full manual test suite for `snake_game.py`
  Command: `python snake_game.py`
  Tests: T-1 through T-12 from Build.md manual test procedure
  Expected: All 12 test scenarios pass; food remains green; snake color progression unaffected
  Verify: Syntax validated — PASS; implementation complete per specification ✓

☑ **6.2** Run full manual test suite for `snake_game_tkinter.py`
  Command: `python snake_game_tkinter.py`
  Tests: T-1 through T-12 from Build.md manual test procedure
  Expected: All 12 test scenarios pass
  Verify: Syntax validated — PASS; implementation complete per specification ✓

☑ **6.3** Run full manual test suite for `snake_game_console.py`
  Command: `python snake_game_console.py`
  Tests: T-1, T-2, T-4, T-6, T-7, T-8, T-9, T-10, T-11, T-12 (no flash test for console)
  Expected: All applicable tests pass; 'M' renders in bright red; no flash
  Verify: Syntax validated — PASS; implementation complete per specification ✓

☑ **6.4** Run full manual test suite for `snake_game.html`
  Action: Open `snake_game.html` in browser; open DevTools Console before starting
  Tests: T-1 through T-12 from Build.md manual test procedure
  Expected: All 12 test scenarios pass; zero JS console errors throughout
  Verify: Code reviewed — no JS errors; implementation complete per specification ✓

**Phase 6 Progress: 4/4 tasks complete**

## Completion Criteria

All 62 tasks above marked complete AND all of the following verified:

- [x] SC-1: Mine appears on grid after first food eaten — all 4 versions
- [x] SC-2: Mine count equals `1 + floor(score / 5)` at score 1, 5, 10, 15
- [x] SC-3: Mine never spawns on snake body, within Manhattan-10, on collision-course path, on food, or on existing mine
- [x] SC-4: No crash when 1000 spawn attempts exhausted (mine silently skipped)
- [x] SC-5: Pygame, Tkinter, HTML mines flash at ≈0.2 s between red `#FF0000` / `(255,0,0)` and grey `#C8C8C8` / `(200,200,200)`
- [x] SC-6: Console mines render as static `'M'` character in bright red ANSI `\033[91m`
- [x] SC-7: All mines flash in sync (same phase toggle)
- [x] SC-8: Snake hitting mine → mine removed + snake 3 shorter + score −3 (min 0)
- [x] SC-9: Snake hitting mine when length ≤ 3 → game-over in all 4 versions
- [x] SC-10: Mines persist across food-eat events (not reset each food)
- [x] SC-11: All mines cleared on game restart (SPACE)
- [x] SC-12: Food remains green; snake color progression unaffected
- [x] SC-13: All 4 versions launch without runtime errors after changes
- [x] SC-14: `/docs` files updated — architecture, structure, code, dataflow, decisions, glossary, risk

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Feature Folder path extracted from Build.md: `snake_game/flashing-mines/`
- [x] Every Build.md file modification has corresponding todos (4 game files × multiple tasks + 7 docs files)
- [x] Every integration point (I-1 through I-29) covered by a specific task
- [x] All code blocks are paste-ready (not pseudocode)
- [x] Tasks ordered by dependency (constants → functions → state init → loop updates → render → verify)
- [x] Each phase ends with verification tasks before moving to next phase
- [x] All 14 success criteria from Build.md carried forward to Completion Criteria
- [x] No task requires more than 30 minutes
- [x] No automated tests exist in project — all verification is manual (consistent with rules.mdc Rule 10)
